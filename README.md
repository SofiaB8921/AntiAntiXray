# AntiAntiXray
A fabric mod that bypasses the Ore obfuscator plugins. This is an actively maintained fork of another now seemingly discontinued fork.

# Important note regarding original creator
I didn't make this mod, it is a fork of another project which is for 1.16.4 and hasn't been updated for 2 years. The project said this was originally made by Constantin who as far as I can see no longer has a github account.

## Notice from original creator
For every plugin dev reading this, you basically cant fix this unless you want everyone on the server to gain riches off fake blocks that suddenly become real ;)

## Usage
To scan nearby blocks in a selected radius, press `G` ingame.
To remove a block for testing, creating a ghost block, press `V` ingame.

## Installing
1. Download the release you want from https://github.com/SofiaB8921/AntiAntiXray/releases
2. Put it into your mods folder in your fabric installation of the corresponding minecraft version

## Commands
All commands can be viewed using `:help`
