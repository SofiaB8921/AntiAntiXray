# AntiAntiXray
For the annoying server owners that add an anti xray plugin.

# Important note regarding original creator
I didn't make this mod, but Constantin as he is known in the commit messages did, and this repo is just a fork for when the project was acively maintained 

## Notice
For every plugin dev reading this, you basically cant fix this unless you want everyone on the server to gain riches off fake blocks that suddently become real ;)

## Usage
To scan nearby blocks in selected radius, press `G` ingame.

To remove a block for testing, creating a ghost block, press `V` ingame.

## Installing
1. Download the newest version from build/libs (or click [here](https://github.com/AriliusClient/AntiAntiXray/raw/master/build/libs/AntiAntiXray-1.7.jar))

3. Enjoy
